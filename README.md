# PENTApp
##I developed "PENTA", a social media platform where people anonymously voice their opinions and live day to day.
##Since PENTA is still in development, I am open to those who want to fork and contribute to PENTA.
##Coming soon features: liking, disliking pentas, making them appear on your own profile, etc.

To run the application on your own computer:

First, it must be entered in the "server" folder
Then run the backend application at "http://localhost:8080/" with the "npm run server" command.

Then enter the "client" folder
Then, with the "npm start" command, the frontend application is run at "http://localhost:3000/"
